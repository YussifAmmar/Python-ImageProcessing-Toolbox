### **Document Explanation of the Code**

#### **1. Introduction**

This Python program is designed to load and display grayscale TIFF images manually (without using high-level image libraries like OpenCV or Pillow). The code manually reads and parses the TIFF file, extracts pixel data, and then displays the image using basic Python libraries.

#### **2. Overview of the Code**

The code does the following:
- Reads a **TIFF** file, specifically in grayscale.
- Parses the file header and image metadata.
- Extracts image pixel data (for grayscale images).
- Displays the image manually using **tkinter** for GUI-based display.

#### **3. Key Components of the Code**

##### **3.1 TIFF Header and Magic Number**

```python
def read_tiff(self, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Read magic number (first 2 bytes) to check if it's a valid TIFF file
        magic_number = int.from_bytes(file.read(2), byteorder='little')
        print(f"Magic number: {hex(magic_number)}")
```

- The **magic number** is a 2-byte signature at the beginning of the TIFF file that indicates the file type. In this case, we read the first two bytes to verify that the file is indeed a valid TIFF file.
- `magic_number` should be `0x4949` (for little-endian) or `0x4D4D` (for big-endian), so the code checks for that.

##### **3.2 Parsing TIFF Image Data**

After verifying the TIFF magic number, the code moves on to read the image data:

```python
def read_tiff(self, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Read and verify the header
        file.seek(4)  # Skip first 4 bytes (offset to next relevant data)
        offset = int.from_bytes(file.read(4), byteorder='little')
        print(f"Offset to IFD: {offset}")

        # Read IFD and retrieve image data (in this case, grayscale image)
        file.seek(offset)
        num_entries = int.from_bytes(file.read(2), byteorder='little')
        print(f"Number of IFD entries: {num_entries}")
```

- The code moves past the header to reach the **Image File Directory (IFD)**, which contains information about the image (e.g., width, height, pixel data).
- The **offset** in the header tells us where the IFD starts. The IFD contains entries about the image's properties, such as the dimensions, number of channels, and more.

##### **3.3 Reading Pixel Data**

Once the TIFF metadata is read and validated, the pixel data is extracted:

```python
def read_pixel_data(self, file, offset):
    # Move the file pointer to the pixel data
    file.seek(offset)
    pixel_data = []
    for row in range(self.height):
        row_data = []
        for col in range(self.width):
            pixel = int.from_bytes(file.read(1), byteorder='little')  # Read one byte per pixel (grayscale)
            row_data.append(pixel)
        pixel_data.append(row_data)
    return pixel_data
```

- **Pixel Data**: The pixel data is read byte-by-byte (grayscale images have one byte per pixel).
- The **width** and **height** of the image are already read from the IFD, and then the pixel data is loaded row-by-row and column-by-column.

##### **3.4 Displaying the Image Using tkinter**

The pixel data is stored in a 2D list (`pixel_data`), which is then used to generate an image for display. `tkinter` is used to create a window and show the image:

```python
def show_image(self):
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.title("TIFF Image")
    
    canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=self.width, height=self.height)
    canvas.pack()

    for row in range(self.height):
        for col in range(self.width):
            pixel_value = self.pixel_data[row][col]
            canvas.create_rectangle(col, row, col + 1, row + 1, fill=self.get_color(pixel_value), width=0)

    root.mainloop()

def get_color(self, pixel_value):
    return f'#{pixel_value:02x}{pixel_value:02x}{pixel_value:02x}'  # Grayscale (R=G=B)
```

- The pixel data is used to create a **rectangle** for each pixel on a **tkinter canvas**.
- The function `get_color` converts each pixel value into a **grayscale** color format (`#RRGGBB`), where all RGB channels are set to the same value (since it's grayscale).
- The `tkinter` canvas is updated with rectangles representing each pixel's intensity.
